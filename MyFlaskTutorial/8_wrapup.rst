Wrap-up
=======

That's the end of the tutorial!  I hope you feel good about building things in Flask.
There's a lot of room to grow from here, but this is a good foundation to start.

You should understand:

- When functions get called in ``application_lulu.py``.
- When HTML templates are used,	where they are stored, and how to pass variables into them.
- How to use HTML forms, particularly labeling the fields and referring to them in the application
- When a request method is GET and when a method is POST.
- How to use the ``redirect`` Flask function, which allows you to return different HTML templates,
  based on the state of the system.

Hopefully you aren't too frustrated with the tutorial or with me for writing it.  :)
